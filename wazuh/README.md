I personally loved the solution, i have implemented it in 2-3 companies as well as in my test lab. One of the best part of WaZuh, apart from being OpenSource is the Design, the rules and the way it helps to create a stratergy to to get alerts.

I have created a script: `custom-email-alerts-v2`, it is an upgrade to the script `custom-email-alerts` with an HTML Email formatted to enhance the Email analysis experience.

## Test Run the Script
```
python3 custom-email-alerts-v2 wazuh-user-alert-v1.json debug ashish.bhandari@lrn.com debug
```

## Add to WaZuh Integrations
